      Medical applications, or medical apps, as they are better known, have revolutionized the healthcare industry. With the common use of apps for all other purposes, apps pertaining to the healthcare industry are a great idea. With many functions from charting daily medical data, to managing medications, to better understanding pharmaceuticals or diagnosing your symptoms and preparing patients for unforeseen medical emergencies, medical apps have taken an existing industry and built themselves a vital role in the lives of many people worldwide.

<p>AliveCor turns your smartphone into an electrocardiogram by snapping onto the back of any iPhone. To take cardiac measurements, the user presses the device against the skin found near the heart. The device has received much recognition for its mobility and the anticipation of its capability to catch irregular heart rhythms earlier.</p>
