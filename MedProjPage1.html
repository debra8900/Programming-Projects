    <h1 class="logoHeader">Smart inhalers work the same way that regular inhalers do. The only difference is that they detect inhaler use and transmit that data. This is done through sensors that attach to existing inhalers and record when medication is taken. The sensors in smart inhaler technology are Bluetooth-enabled, so can be paired wirelessly with a smart device like a phone or tablet or with a computer to allow data to be transferred from the smart inhaler automatically. Smart inhalers work using digital sensors. The digital sensor you need for a smart inhaler can be attached to your existing inhaler. The only thing you have to do is push it and use medication as normal. Your data that a smart inhaler reads can be shared with an app, your doctor, asthma nurse or a hospital team to help tailor care to your needs. Using a smart inhaler will help one to know when and where symptoms flare up to help in identifying personal triggers and allow for more individually tailored management plans.</h1>
