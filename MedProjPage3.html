  The Internet of Things describes the connection of everyday objects and things on a wireless network.
  In healthcare, the Internet of Things is very useful because it is being used to help enhance and better patient care, as well as communication between doctors, patients, and other medical staff. The networks created by the IoT in healthcare with wearable and other devices can be used to help maintain medical facilities, track patient data and send it directly to doctors via cloud technology, deliver information to and from doctors, and more!
